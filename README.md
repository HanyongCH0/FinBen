## Abstract
PortBench is a benchmark generation framework designed to evaluate investment decision-making capabilities based on portfolio theory.
Unlike existing financial benchmarks that primarily focus on natural language understanding, PortBench aims to provide a more practical evaluation grounded in real-world financial reasoning.
It assesses whether language models can perform asset allocation tasks based on financial theory, moving beyond simple language comprehension.
Users can generate and evaluate customized benchmarks flexibly by combining a variety of variables to suit their specific needs.
